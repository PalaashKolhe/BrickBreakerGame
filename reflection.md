# Reflection

This project was a great method of learning the definition and applications of inheritance. The uses of inheritance was taught quite well through the sprites class in the lessons for this unit; applying them for myself in this project just helped me reinforce that teaching. 

Something I really struggled with in this project would be the collisions between the objects. I had the logic under control, but the actual code was giving me problems. Eventually, I asked for help on this problem from my peers and then I was finally able to get it up and running cleanly.

One thing I was proud of in this project was nesting a call for a class within a class, and this can be seen in the __engine.py__ file. I called the ```Engine``` class within the already running  ```engine``` class, so the program can have infinite levels. This way all the variables are reset, which means I don't have to modify them manually.
