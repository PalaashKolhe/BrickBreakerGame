# External Documentation for Brick Breaker

## Description
Brick Breaker is a game in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the keys 'A' and 'D'. The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. If all lives are lost, the game is over.
